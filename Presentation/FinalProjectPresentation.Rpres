CUNY SPS - DATA 698.4 Capstone

```


Introduction - Accidents in NYC
========================================================
Today in NYC

- Approximately 4,000 people are seriosly injured and over 250 are killed each year in motor vehicle accidents.
- Being struck by a vehicle is the leading cause of injury-related death for children under 14, and the second leading cause for seniors.
- On average, vehicles seriously injure or kill a New Yorker every two hours.
- Pedestrians account for 56% of all New York City traffic fatalities!


Introduction - Vision Zero
========================================================
- An action plan released in 2014, in an effort to reduce traffic fatalities and injuries in NYC.
- Regard every accident as 'preventable incident' that can be systematically addressed.
- A multifaceted approach, incorporating education, engineering, enforcement and legislation.
- 14 different Vision Zero initiatives that are in place today: Slowzones, Speed Humps, Signal Timings, Bike Priority, Enhanced Crossing, Lead Pedestrian Interval, Left Turn Traffic Calming, Safe Streets for Seniors, Priority Corridors, Zones and Intersections
 

<div class="footer">Foundation for ending traffic deaths and injuries on NYC streets</div>

Objectives
========================================================
- Exploratory study / Investigation of factors associated with the traffic incidents in NYC:
  - Who are involved in majority of traffic violations?
  - What are the Key contributing factors to the traffic accidents?
  - Where are the HotSpots?
  - Which locations are more prone to accidents ?

- Impact of **Vision Zero**
  - Before and After *Vision Zero* analysis

- Time series analysis with traffic accident data

Clusters - Why?
========================================================

 - In the past, not having enough spatial data was a hurdle
 - Today, too much data is the probelm !
 - Too many scattered points on a map can be overwhelming !
 - Displaying on a device would be processor intensive !
 - Solution ?
   - Compress spatially redundant data points into a  set of representative features.

<div class="footer">Identify Hotspots</div>

Clustering - Review K-Means
========================================================
- We need to provide K, the number of clusters.
- Place centroids $C_1 ...C_K$ at random locations.
- Repeat until convergence: (Stop when none of the cluster assignments change)
   - for each point $X_i$ :
       - find nearest centroid $C_j$
       - assign the point $X_i$ to cluster j
   - for each cluster j = 1...K:
       - new centroid $c_j$ = mean of all points $X_i$ assinged to cluster j in prior step

<div class="footer">Minmizes variance, but not geodetic distance. Not ideal for our case.</div>


Clustering - DBSCAN
========================================================
 - Human intuitive clustering method best suited for spatial data points (non-flat geometry/uneven clusters).
 - Views clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density
 - Got 2 parameters:
   - *epsilon* , essentially decides the size of the neighborhood.
   - *minPoints*, minimum cluster size
 - You do not need to specify the number of clusters, it determines automatically based on the params.

HotSpots - Algorithm
========================================================
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="36%"}
pedincidents_kde<-c("images/dbscan_hotspots.jpg")
include_graphics(pedincidents_kde)
```


App - HotSpotViewer
========================================================
[Hotspot Viewer](https://data698ssv.shinyapps.io/HotSpotViewer/)

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
HotSpotViewer<-c("images/HotSpotViewer.jpg")
include_graphics(HotSpotViewer)
```

Time Series Analysis - Data Prep
========================================================

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
dda<-c("images/DrvDistractionAccidents.png")
include_graphics(dda)
```

 - Split the dataset - Persons injured in NYC Road Accidents before and after 2017
 - Subset our dataset just for Brooklyn and Accidents caused by 'Driver Distraction'

<div class="footer">Forecast the number of Accidents due to Driver distraction in Brooklyn using Time Series Analysis.</div>


Time Series Analysis - EDA
========================================================

 - During data preprocessing use convert data to monthly averages
 - Train Dataset 55, Test dataset 15
 - Explore this time series as a data visualization

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
tseda1<-c("images/TS_Explore_1.png")
include_graphics(tseda1)
```

Time Series Analysis - ARIMA
========================================================

 - ARIMA is a model that can be fitted to time series data to better understand and predict future points in the series.
 - ARIMA(p,d,q) model, where:
   	- p is the number of autoregressive terms,
   	- d is the number of non-seasonal differences needed for stationarity, and
   	- q is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.
    Let y denote the dth difference of Y, which means:
 - If d=0:  $y_t =  Y_t$
 - If d=1:  $y_t =  Y_t - Y_{t-1}$
 - If d=2:  $y_t =  (Y_t - Y_{t-1}) - (Y_{t-1} - Y_{t-2})  =  Y_t - 2Y_{t-1} + Y_{t-2}$	 (discrete analog of a second derivative)
 

Time Series Analysis - Dickey-Fuller test
========================================================

 - ACF (autocorrelation function) and PACF (partial autocorrelation) plots are used to find the AR(p) and MA(q) terms.
 
 - We used Dickey-Fuller test see whether the TS is Stationary or not: The test results comprise of a Test Statistic and some Critical Values for different confidence levels. If the 'Test Statistic' is less than the 'Critical Value', then the series is stationary.
 
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
tsdf1<-c("images/TS_RM_SD_1.png")
include_graphics(tsdf1)
```


Time Series Analysis - Eliminate trend.
========================================================

 - We used the log transformation of the series. The moving average for the last 12 values we used Pandas rolling statistics functions.
 - To eliminate seasonality used Differencing which takes the difference with a time lag.
 
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
tsdf2<-c("images/TS_RM_SD_2.png")
include_graphics(tsdf2)
```

<div class="footer">Dickey-Fuller Test Statistic is less than the 1% critical value, thus the TS is stationary with 99% confidence.</div>


Time Series Analysis - Model.
========================================================

 - Our model shows that there is a not much variation  in the number of accidents due to DISTRACTED DRIVING from 2017 onwards. 
 - But in reality, there is no trend. We will continue our study with other Accident Factors also.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
tsmodel<-c("images/TS_Model.JPG")
include_graphics(tsmodel)
```


Conclusion
========================================================
 - Mixed results from vision zero analysis
 - Human factors ( driver distraction, improper driving ) are major reasons for the accidents.
 - Brooklyn and Queens had accidents resulting in more injuries / deaths.
 - Younger drivers cause over 50% of violations.
 - Hotspot viewer shows reduced pedestrian spots after VZ initiative. However no such indication in multi vehicle incidents.
 - Time series analysis forecasted a gradual decrease in incidents.
 
 

Future Work
========================================================
 - Include more incident data sets
 - Combine with weather data.
 - Investigate the factors (environment factors like weather) for the sudden increase of incidents in 2017.
